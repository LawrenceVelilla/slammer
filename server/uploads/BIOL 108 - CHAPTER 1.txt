What are the three main components of biodiversity?	1.) Genetic Diversity 2.) Species Diversity 3.) Ecosystem Diversity (Remember the Pneumonic 'EGS')
Define Genetic Diversity?	The genetic variation within a population and between populations of a single species
Define Species Diversity	The variety of different species living/present within a specific region or habitat. (Most commonly used unit for monitoring biodiversity)
Define Ecosystem Diversity	The variety of different habitats in a region and the complex ecological interactions that occur within them.
What are the 4 benefits of Biodiversity?	Provisioning Servies, Regulating Services, Cultural Services, Supporting Services
What are Provisioning Services?	The products that humans recieve/obtain from nature, such as raw materials, food, medicines, and water.
What are Regulating Services?	Benefits humans recieve beyond raw materials, such as climate regulation, water/air purification, pollination and pest control.
What are Cultural Services?	Non-material benefits derived from nature, such as recreational, aesthetic, and spiritual experienes.
What is the difference between Extinction and Extirpation?	Extirpation is the disappearance of a species from a specific geograpic area, but continues to exist elsewhere.&nbsp;<br>Extinction is the complete loss of a species (no living individuals)
What is the difference between Endangered and Threatened Species?	Endangered are at risk of Extinction<br>Threatened are at risk of bein Endangered
What is the greatest threat to biodiversity?	Habitat Loss
What are the 4 threats to biodiversity?	1.) Habitat Loss<br>2.) Overexploitation<br>3.) Climate Change<br>4.) Invasive Species
What is an Invasive Species?	An introduced species that spreads rapidly because it lacks native predators causong harm to the environment
Define Overexploitation	Overharvesting plants and animals at unsustainable rates, leading to population declines.
How does Global Climate Change threaten biodiversity?	The climate is changing faster than species can adapt. Whiel some species may expand their range, habitat framentaion limits this, and pests/disease also expand their range.
What is Taxonomy?	The scientific discipline of naming and classifying organisms.
What is Nomenclature?	The specific way of naming things
Why are common names problematic in science? (3 reasons)	Cultural/Regional<br>1.) Different names for the same species<br>2.) Same name for different species<br>3.) Common names imply false relationships (e.g., Jellyfish are not fish)
What is the correct format for writing Binomial Name?	1.) Genus is first and Capitalized<br>2.) Specific/Species Epithet is second and lowercase<br>3.) The entire name should be italicized<br><br>PS. New species are ns sp
"In the mnemonic ""Great Scientists Investigate Every Animal,"" what do the letters stand for regarding naming rules?"	"<strong>G</strong>enus name first.<br><strong>S</strong>pecific epithet follows.<br><strong>I</strong>talicize the entire name.<br><strong>E</strong>pithets are lowercase.<br><strong>A</strong>bbreviation of genus allowed (e.g.,&nbsp;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. sapiens</span>)."

What is Systematics?	Systematics classifies organims bassed on their evolutionary history (phylogeny)
What is the difference between Taxonomy and Systematics?	<strong>Taxonomy</strong>&nbsp;names and classifies based on similarities.<br><strong>Systematics</strong>&nbsp;classifies organisms based on their&nbsp;<strong>evolutionary history (phylogeny)</strong>.
What does phylogeny depict?	Evolutionary relationships among both extinct and living organisms as lines of evolutionary descent from common ancestors
What does the Branch Point (Node) represent?	The common ancestor of the two lineages descending from that node (speciation event)
Define Sister Taxa.	Two groups that share an immediate common ancestor not shared with any other taxa (they are each other's closest relative)

What is Homology?	Similarity due to shared ancestry
What is Analogy (Homoplasy)?&nbsp;	Similarity due to convergent evolution (adaptation to similar environments), and not due to shared ancestry
What is a Paraphyletic group?	A group that consists of common ancestor but not ALL of its ancestor. (A clade with a missing descendant)
What is Polyphyletic?	A group that includes distantly related taxa but does NOT include the common ancestor of the group members
What is the purpose of the Outgroup?	Serves as a reference point to determine which traits are ancestral and which are derived in the ingroup
Define Symplesiomorphy	A shared Ancestral Character.<br><br>A trait shared by a group but inhereted from a distant ancestor. (Not useful when defining clades)
What are Ancestral traits?	Older characteristics inherited from distant common ancestors
What are Derived Traits?	Newer features that evolved later in a specific lineage
Define Synapomorphy	A shared Derived Character<br><br>A trait that is uniqe to a clade and evolved in its Most Recent Common Ancestor (used to define clades)

"<strong>Symplesiomorphy (Shared Ancestral).</strong><br>Because four legs evolved&nbsp;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">before</span>&nbsp;the amniotes (in Tetrapods) and are shared by frogs/salamanders too."
What is Maximum Parsimony?	The principle that the best phylogenetic tree is the one that requires the fewest evolutionary changes (simplest explainations)
In the scientific name&nbsp;<i>Canis lupus,</i>&nbsp;which word is the specific Specific Epithet?	<i>lupus</i>
What are Morphological Data regarding Fossils?	Applicable to both extant (living) and extinct (fossil) species.
What are Molecular Data regarding Fossils?	Applies to extant species, but usually&nbsp;<strong>CANNOT</strong>&nbsp;be used for fossils (DNA degrades).
What is Dichotomous Branching?	When a lineage splits into exactly&nbsp;<strong>two</strong>&nbsp;branches at a node.
"Does the position of a taxon at the&nbsp;<strong>edge</strong>&nbsp;(far right) of a phylogenetic tree mean it is ""more advanced"" or ""highly evolved""?"	"<strong>No.</strong>&nbsp;Phylogenies show relationships, not progress.<br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">(Example: Humans are not ""more advanced"" than bacteria just because they appear on the right side of a specific tree layout; lineages evolve independently).</span>"
What are the four main types of corroborating evidence used to confirm&nbsp;<strong>Homology</strong>?	1. Anatomical similarities (structure).<br>2. Developmental similarities (embryos).<br>3. Genetic similarities (DNA).<br>4. Evolutionary history (fossil record).
How does&nbsp;<strong>Complexity</strong>&nbsp;help differentiate Homology from Analogy?	The&nbsp;<strong>more complex</strong>&nbsp;two similar structures are, the&nbsp;<strong>more likely</strong>&nbsp;they are Homologous (shared ancestry) rather than Analogous (convergent evolution).

"<strong>Parsimony:</strong>&nbsp;Chooses the tree with the&nbsp;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">fewest</span>&nbsp;changes (simplest).<br><strong>Likelihood:</strong>&nbsp;Uses&nbsp;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">statistical probabilities</span>&nbsp;of specific evolutionary changes (like mutation rates) to find the most likely tree."
"Who proposed the theory of ""Descent with Modification"" and in what year was&nbsp;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">On the Origin of Species</span>&nbsp;published?"	<strong>Charles Darwin</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>1859</strong>.
"How did&nbsp;<strong>Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's</strong>&nbsp;theory of ""Transformism"" differ from Darwin's Natural Selection?"	Lamarck believed in the&nbsp;<strong>inheritance of acquired characteristics</strong>&nbsp;(traits gained during a lifetime, like muscle from use, are passed down).<br>Darwin proved that only&nbsp;<strong>heritable</strong>&nbsp;(genetic) traits are passed down and subject to selection.
What role did&nbsp;<strong>Thomas Malthus</strong>&nbsp;play in influencing Darwin?	"Malthus wrote about human population growth exceeding resources. Darwin applied this to nature, realizing it leads to&nbsp;<strong>competition for limited resources</strong>&nbsp;(the ""struggle for existence"")."
What are the&nbsp;<strong>two main observations</strong>&nbsp;Darwin made that lead to the inference of Natural Selection?	1.&nbsp;<strong>Variation + Heritability:</strong>&nbsp;Individuals vary in traits, and some traits are heritable.<br>2.&nbsp;<strong>Overproduction + Competition:</strong>&nbsp;More offspring are produced than can survive, leading to a struggle for resources.
What is&nbsp;<strong>Artificial Selection</strong>?	The process where&nbsp;<strong>humans</strong>&nbsp;modify species by selecting and breeding individuals with desired traits (e.g., crops, dog breeds).
"What provides the ""raw material"" that natural selection acts upon?"	"<div><strong>Genetic diversity</strong>&nbsp;(Genotypic variation).<br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">(Note: Selection cannot act on non-heritable phenotypic variation, like a tan).</span></div><br>"
Define&nbsp;<strong>Selection Pressure</strong>.	"The effect a selective agent (environmental factor) has on a population's survival and reproduction.<br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">(Example: Drought is a selection pressure; lack of seeds is the result).</span>"
True or False: Natural Selection acts on populations, but Evolution occurs in individuals.	<strong>False.</strong><br>Natural Selection acts on&nbsp;<strong>individuals</strong>&nbsp;(they survive or die).<br>Evolution occurs in&nbsp;<strong>populations</strong>&nbsp;(trait frequencies change over generations).
"n the&nbsp;<strong>1977 Drought</strong>&nbsp;on Daphne Major, what happened to the food source and the&nbsp;<strong>Medium Ground Finch</strong>&nbsp;(<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Geospiza fortis</span>) population?"	<ol><li><div><strong>Food:</strong>&nbsp;Small soft seeds disappeared; only&nbsp;<strong>large, hard cactus seeds</strong>&nbsp;remained.</div></li><li><div><strong>Selection:</strong>&nbsp;Birds with&nbsp;<strong>larger/deeper beaks</strong>&nbsp;survived (could crack the seeds).</div></li><li><div><strong>Result:</strong>&nbsp;The average beak depth increased in the next generation (1978).</div></li></ol>
In&nbsp;<strong>2004</strong>, another drought occurred, but the evolutionary outcome was different. Why?	<ol><li><div><strong>Competition:</strong>&nbsp;A new species, the&nbsp;<strong>Large Ground Finch</strong>, had arrived and outcompeted the Medium finches for large seeds.</div></li><li><div><strong>Selection:</strong>&nbsp;Medium Ground Finches with&nbsp;<strong>smaller beaks</strong>&nbsp;were favoured (to eat small seeds that the large finches ignored).</div></li><li><div><strong>Result:</strong>&nbsp;Average beak size&nbsp;<strong>decreased</strong>.</div></li></ol>
What key principle of Natural Selection does the&nbsp;<strong>2004 Finch event</strong>&nbsp;demonstrate regarding direction?	"Natural selection is&nbsp;<strong>context-dependent and reversible</strong>.<br>(Traits are not inherently ""better""; it depends on the current environment and competitors)."
What are the four main categories of evidence for evolution?	1. Direct observations (e.g., drug resistance).<br>2. Homologies (Morphological, Embryonic, Molecular).<br>3. Fossil record.<br>4. Biogeography.
Give two examples of&nbsp;<strong>Direct Observation</strong>&nbsp;of evolutionary change from your slides.	"1.&nbsp;<strong>Soapberry bugs</strong>&nbsp;(beak size change with introduced plants).<br>2.&nbsp;<strong>Antibiotic resistance</strong>&nbsp;(MRSA /&nbsp;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Staphylococcus aureus</span>).<br>3.&nbsp;<strong>Peppered Moth</strong>&nbsp;(Industrial melanism)."

What are Morphological Homologies?	Physical resemblances representing variations on a structural theme present in a common ancestor
What are Homologous Embryonic Structures?	Structures of two species share structures indicating that these species share a common ancestor.
What are Vestigial Structures?	Structures that were functional in an organism's ancestors (wisdom teeth)
What are Molecular Homologies?	Shared molecular sequences, such as gene/protein similarites, show a hierarchy of relatedness that reflects phylogony

Who proposed the theory of&nbsp;<strong>Catastrophism</strong>, and what did it suggest about extinction?	"He argued that species&nbsp;<strong>do go extinct</strong>&nbsp;caused by catastrophic events (floods, volcanoes), and new species immigrate from other areas to replace them.<br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">(He rejected evolution itself).</span>"
"Who proposed&nbsp;<strong>Gradualism</strong>&nbsp;(Uniformitarianism) and the idea that ""The present is the key to the past""?"	<strong>Charles Lyell</strong>&nbsp;(1830).<br>He argued Earth is very old and shaped by slow, cumulative processes (which influenced Darwin to think biological changes could also accumulate slowly).
What is the difference between&nbsp;<strong>Genotypic Variation</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Phenotypic Variation</strong>?	<strong>Genotypic:</strong>&nbsp;Differences in DNA among individuals (heritable).<br><strong>Phenotypic:</strong>&nbsp;Observable traits (determined by Genotype + Environment).

Economic Species Concept	defines species based on their role in the ecological economy, focusing on how they interact as units of resource competition
What is a&nbsp;<strong>Prezygotic Barrier</strong>?	A reproductive barrier that prevents mating or fertilization&nbsp;<strong>before</strong>&nbsp;a zygote is formed.
"The snails&nbsp;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Bradybaena</span>&nbsp;have shells that spiral in opposite directions, preventing their genital openings from aligning. What specific type of reproductive barrier is this?"	<strong>Mechanical Isolation</strong>&nbsp;(Prezygotic).
"Two species of Skunk (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Spilogale</span>) overlap geographically, but one mates in late summer and the other in late winter. What type of isolation is this?"	<strong>Temporal Isolation</strong>&nbsp;(Prezygotic).
Sea urchins release sperm and eggs into the water, but the sperm of one species cannot fertilize the eggs of another due to chemical incompatibility. What type of isolation is this?	<strong>Gametic Isolation</strong>&nbsp;(Prezygotic).
What is a&nbsp;<strong>Postzygotic Barrier</strong>? List the three types.	<div>Barriers that occur&nbsp;<strong>after</strong>&nbsp;fertilization (preventing the hybrid from developing or reproducing).</div><ol><li><div>Reduced hybrid viability (frail/dies).</div></li><li><div>Reduced hybrid fertility (sterile, e.g., Mule).</div></li><li><div>Hybrid breakdown (offspring of hybrids are weak/sterile).</div></li></ol>
What is the difference between&nbsp;<strong>Allopatric</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Sympatric</strong>&nbsp;speciation?	<strong>Allopatric:</strong>&nbsp;Speciation occurs when a population is&nbsp;<strong>geographically separated</strong>&nbsp;(e.g., mountains, rivers).<br><strong>Sympatric:</strong>&nbsp;Speciation occurs in populations that live in the&nbsp;<strong>same geographic area</strong>&nbsp;(no physical barrier).
The formation of the Isthmus of Panama separated marine populations, leading to 15 pairs of sister species of&nbsp;<strong>Snapping Shrimp</strong>. This is an example of what type of speciation?	<strong>Allopatric Speciation</strong>&nbsp;(specifically via&nbsp;<strong>Vicariance</strong>).
How can&nbsp;<strong>Polyploidy</strong>&nbsp;lead to Sympatric Speciation?	"&nbsp;An error in cell division results in extra sets of chromosomes. These individuals can no longer breed with the diploid parent population (gametic incompatibility), creating a new species instantly within the same area.<br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">(Common in plants, e.g., Wheat).</span>"
"The Apple Maggot Fly (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Rhagoletis pomonella</span>) is diversifying from the native Hawthorn-feeding population because they now feed/mate on introduced apples. This is an example of Sympatric Speciation driven by what?"	<strong>Habitat Differentiation</strong>&nbsp;(exploiting a new ecological niche).
What is&nbsp;<strong>Reinforcement</strong>&nbsp;in a hybrid zone?	When hybrids are&nbsp;<strong>less fit</strong>&nbsp;than parents, natural selection strengthens prezygotic barriers (e.g., mate choice) to prevent wasted reproductive effort, reducing hybridization over time.
Define&nbsp;<strong>Microevolution</strong>.	&nbsp;Small-scale change in&nbsp;<strong>allele frequencies</strong>&nbsp;within a population over time.
What is a&nbsp;<strong>Gene Pool</strong>?	The complete collection of all alleles found in all individuals within a population.
What are the four mechanisms that cause Microevolution?	1. Natural Selection.<br>2. Genetic Drift.<br>3. Gene Flow.<br>4. Mutation.
Only one of the four mechanisms of microevolution consistently causes&nbsp;<strong>Adaptive Evolution</strong>. Which one is it?	"<strong>Natural Selection</strong>.<br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">(Drift, Flow, and Mutation are random/non-adaptive regarding fitness).</span>"
Define&nbsp;<strong>Genetic Drift</strong>.	"Random changes in allele frequencies due to chance events in reproduction.<br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">(Has the strongest effect in&nbsp;<strong>small</strong>&nbsp;populations).</span>"
What is the&nbsp;<strong>Bottleneck Effect</strong>? Give an example from the slides	"A sharp reduction in population size due to a disaster, leaving a surviving population with reduced genetic diversity.<br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Examples:</span>&nbsp;Greater Prairie Chicken (habitat loss), Cheetahs (Ice age/poaching)."
What is the&nbsp;<strong>Founder Effect</strong>?	"When a small group establishes a new population. The new gene pool represents only a small fraction of the original diversity.<br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">(Often explains the high frequency of rare hereditary diseases in isolated human populations).</span>"
Define&nbsp;<strong>Gene Flow</strong>. What is its general effect on two populations?	The movement of alleles between populations (migration).<br>It tends to&nbsp;<strong>reduce differences</strong>&nbsp;between populations (makes them more homogenous).
Define&nbsp;<strong>Directional Selection</strong>.	"Selection that favours individuals at&nbsp;<strong>one extreme</strong>&nbsp;of the phenotypic range, shifting the population mean.<br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">(Example: Finches evolving larger beaks during drought).</span>"
Define&nbsp;<strong>Disruptive Selection</strong>.	"Selection that favours individuals at&nbsp;<strong>both extremes</strong>&nbsp;of the range, while intermediate phenotypes have lower fitness.<br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">(Example: Black-bellied seedcrackers - small beaks for soft seeds, large beaks for hard seeds).</span>"
Define&nbsp;<strong>Stabilizing Selection</strong>.	"Selection that favours&nbsp;<strong>intermediate</strong>&nbsp;variants and selects against extremes.<br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">(Example: Human birth weights - very small and very large babies have higher mortality)</span>"
What is&nbsp;<strong>Heterozygote Advantage</strong>? Give the classic human example.	"&nbsp;When heterozygous individuals have greater fitness than both homozygotes.<br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Example:</span>&nbsp;<strong>Sickle Cell Trait.</strong>&nbsp;Heterozygotes (AS) are resistant to malaria and do not suffer severe sickle cell disease, so the allele is maintained."
What is&nbsp;<strong>Negative Frequency-Dependent Selection</strong>?	"When the fitness of a phenotype&nbsp;<strong>increases</strong>&nbsp;as it becomes&nbsp;<strong>rarer</strong>.<br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">(Example: Scale-eating fish - ""Left-mouthed"" fish succeed when ""Right-mouthed"" fish are too common and prey expect them).</span>"
"Why can't Natural Selection produce ""perfect"" organisms? (Give 2 reasons)."	1. Selection can only act on&nbsp;<strong>existing variations</strong>&nbsp;(can't invent new alleles).<br>2. Evolution is limited by&nbsp;<strong>historical constraints</strong>&nbsp;(modifies existing structures).<br>3. Adaptations are often&nbsp;<strong>compromises</strong>&nbsp;(e.g., giraffe neck length vs. blood pressure).<br>4. Chance/Drift interacts with selection.
Adaptation	Inherited characteristics of organisms that enhance their chances of survival and reproduction in specific enviornments
Mutation	Any change in an organism's DNA sequence. Occurs randomly and are not directed by selection pressure. The original source of all genetic variation
4 types of mutational change	1.) Point mutation: Single-based substitutions or small insertions/deletions. Mild/Non-harmful<br>2.) Chromosomal Mutation: Large modificaitons. Can be detrimential to the organism<br>3.) Gene duplications: Occur through the duplicaition fo small segments of DNA and can result in new gen functions<br>4.) Whole-genome duplications: These increase genome complexity and can play a significant role in driving major evolutionary transitions.
How does Sexual Reproduction increases genetic variation in populations?	- Recombination of homologous chromosomes and indpendent assortment of alleles during meiosis shuffles existign alleles, producing new combinations<br>- Random mating among organisms and random fertilization combine alleles from different individuals, increasing genetic diversity
What changes allele frequencies in populations?	- Natural Selection (causes adaptive evolution)<br>- Non-adaptive evolution<br>- Genetic Drift<br>- Gene Flow<br>- Mutation
How does&nbsp;<b>Natural Selection&nbsp;</b>change allele frequencies in populations?	Causes adaptive evolution (where a feature or trait that provides an advantage to an individual possessing it).&nbsp;
Three models of natural selection:	- Disruptive Selection (Prefers both ends of the extreme)<br>- Directional Selection (Prefers something that is different from the average)<br>- Stabalizing Selection (Prefers common, intermediate)
Directional Selection	The geneic makeup of a population shifts toward a new phenotype with higher relative fitness when it is exposed to selection pressures (response to consistent selective pressures).<br><br>Directional shift in the mean phenotype of the population. However, overtime can lead to loss of genotyphic variety (alleles not favoured are eventually lost).
Disruptive Selection	Favours individuals at both extremes of the phenotypic range. Helps maintain genetic variation in populations.
Stabalizing Selection	Common. Reduces genetic variation. Extremes are selected against.
Genetic Drift	The random changes in allele frequencies of a population from one generation to the next due to chance events in reproduction
Balancing Selection	Includes various mechanisms that maintain genetic diversity by favouring the maintenance of stable frequencies in the gene pool of&nbsp; a population<br><br>Works by favouring different alleles in different instances, ensuring multiple alleles remain present
Heterozygote Advantage	Individuals with two different alleles of a prticular gene (heterozygotes) have greater fitness than individuals with two identical alleles (homozygotes)
Dispersal vs. Vicariance	<b>Dispersal:&nbsp;</b>Where a small population becomes isolated at the edge of a larger population, leading to rapid genetic divergence.<br><b>Vicariance</b>: The range of a species is split by a change of environment
2 Causes of Sympatric Speciation	- Chromosomal errors during meiosis or hybridization or closely related species. (Polyploidy and hybrid speciation)<br>- Natural Selection for reproductive isolation
Polyploid	Organisms with different number of chromosome sets than their parental forms (Can only interbreeed with individuals of the same ploidy<br><br>Can produce new sympatric species within a single generation<br><br>Arise from:<br>- Hybridization of related species to form allopolyploids<br>- Chromosomal errors during meiosis form autopolyploids
Allopolyploids	Species with multiple sets of chromosomes derived from the hybridization of different speicies.<br><br>Can arise spontaneously&nbsp; by genome doubling or by fusion of 2n gametes
Homoploids	Arise when hybridization produces novel combinations of genes that can adapt hybrids to new habitats that cause them them to be reproductively isolated from parental populations.
Habitat Differentiation	he ecological process where sub-populations of a species evolve distinct adaptations to occupy different microhabitats or niches within the same geographic area.<br><br>Increases reproductive isolation between subpopulations
Sexual Selection	Individuals with certain inherited traits are more successful at obtaining mates.<br><br>Can reduce interbreeding creating reproductive barriers
Sexual Dimorphism	Distinct differences in secondary sexual traits between males and females<br><br>Secondary Sexual traits are not directly involved but can enhance reproductive success by influencing mate choice and selection.
Assortive mating	Occurs when individuals preferentially mate with others who share specific traits.<br><br>Can split population into two reproductively isolated groups.
How are hybrid zones informative?	- Show if and how much gene flow occurs between diverging species<br>- Measure fitness of hybrids, revealing the strength of reproductive barriers and the factos causing reproductive isolation<br>- Predict Evolutionary outcomes

Quantitative data	Recorder measurements
Inductive Reasoning	A logical method used to form general conclusion based on specific observations or evidence<br><br>Can be used to make generalizations after repeated observations.
Hypothesis	A proposed explanation for a set of observations based on the available data and guided by inductive reasoning<br><br>Knowledge-based and tentative
What is Deductive reasoning used for?	Making specific predictions that can be used to test hypotheses
T/F: Can an experiment prove that a hypothesis is true?	<b>False.</b><br>Hypotheses can only be supported or falsified through experimentation<br><br>Repeated testing with different experimental approaches can increase confidence in a hypothesis
Correlation	A relationship or association between two variables (Does not imply causation)
Causation	Indicates that one variable has a direct effect on another (established through controlled experiments)
Scientific Theories	Broad, unifying explanations of natural phenomena, supported by extensive evidence and are widely accepted withing the scientific community<br><br>(Hypotheses that withstand rigorous and repeated testing, and are supported by substantial body of evidence)
Hypotheses vs. Theory	Hypotheses&nbsp;<b>Predict</b>&nbsp;<br>Theories&nbsp;<b>Explains</b>
